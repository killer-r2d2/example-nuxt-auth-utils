# Nuxt Auth Utils Example Project

This is a test project for exploring and implementing authentication using [nuxt-auth-utils](https://github.com/atinux/nuxt-auth-utils).

Project inspired by the tutorial: [Authentication in Nuxt 3 with nuxt-auth-utils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEfTI1N9Mm8)

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: This project uses 'admin' as the password for demonstration purposes only. This is extremely unsafe and should NEVER be used in a production environment. Always use strong, unique passwords and proper security measures in real applications.

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
